Installation
============

Requirements
------------

PyPCOM is designed to work with Selenium_, and as a result, depends on it for
some things. Installing PyPCOM will automatically install Selenium_ for Python
as well, if you don't already have it, so you shouldn't have to do anything
extra to get it working.

Installing PyPCOM
-----------------

Just like with most other Python packages, you can install it from PyPI using
pip_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pypcom

You can also install it from the source:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

.. _Selenium: http://seleniumhq.org/
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
