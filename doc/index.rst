PyPCOM - Python Page Component Object Model
===========================================

PyPCOM is a component based Page Object Model meant to work with Selenium_, that
is designed to make Page Object development and maintanence significantly faster
and easier, while at the same time making your structures easier to work with
and much more extensible and reusable. It does this by allowing you to break up
your pages into logical components with their own namespace and functionality,
while still allowing you to treat every component as if it were an element.

Still not convinced? Check out the :ref:`why_use` section for a more detailed
explanation on what PyPCOM offers.
